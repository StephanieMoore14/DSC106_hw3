* Explainations of limitations:

For my assignment, there are limitations of my own replicaion and of the overall template we were trying to follow. For my own design, I was not able to get the pie chart to toggle between the bar and pie chart. I also was not able to get the dynamic legend working (I understand the basic html format but not how to connect the data to it). For the stacked area, it represents vaguely what the example looks like but is missing the specifics like the date and time on the top and the correct date formatting (which i may add was in unix timestamps which is a hassle to work with). Overall, the majority of what my replication lacks is the detailed interactivity. 

The limitations, or room for improvment I noticed on the actual template had to do with the readability of the charts in general. I thought they had too many series on them making the charts, specifically the pie chart, not very easy to look at or useful for making decisions. I also thought the color choice for the generation data was not super meaningful and actually confusing because some were so similar. Overall, the purpose of this dashboard was not every clear either. So I believe this design lacked in being readable and "empowering".

* Usage Citations:

The zingcharts example was a pretty useful reference and I got the majority of my code for handling and process the reading of the data from there. It was also useful for understanding the "updating" process of the "globalEnergyData" and laying out a general outline for how to deal with the dynamic charting. I was able to go through the "mouseover" function with a TA and understand it so I could know what to look for online when trying to use Highcharts version. Additionally, the zingcharts example and week 6 discussion helped me with the basic understanding of the html containers for the dashboard and how to used a sharedGrid. (I've included the zingcharts solution from the TAs in my file). The layout of the html I was able to walk through with the TAs. Their patience in explaining and taking the time to draw out on paper what was happening made it easier to visualize and intuitivly figure out how to set up the format for the legend.

* General Comments:

The good things I took away from this assignment were learning to focus on the foundation of a problem (on paper evern) first and just try to work piece by piece, instead of jumping right into coding. Trying to edit the zingcharts solution until it worked for highcharts was very tedious and quite unsuccessful. Although my submission is not a accurate replica of the dashboard, I learned a lot about the overall process of data visualization;  how difficult it can be, but also how important it is to not get overwhelmed by the complexity and start with the basics.
